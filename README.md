# portfolio_project_react

Portfolio project - React

This is a project from Advanced React course from Meta on Coursera.
The portfolio page is a single page that contains the following sections:

- A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page
- A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio
- A section to display featured projects as cards in a grid fashion
- A contact me section with a submit form

Content, custom hooks and some basic code is provided by Meta, but I am implementing the solution according to the task.
Additional libraries used: Chakra UI, Formik, Yup
